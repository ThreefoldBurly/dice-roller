# Dice Roller

A simple six-sided dice roller. You can specify a number of dice to be rolled and then roll them. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

This helped me a lot when I taught myself how to build a GUI with *Java Swing* library back in 2011. I remember even drawing the dice in *AutoCAD* first to know how to tell *Swing* what to draw.

#### HOW TO RUN

After cloning the repo add a `bin` directory to it and (on Linux) run commands:

`javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/diceroller/*.java`

`java -cp bin diceroller.DiceGUI`

in a terminal.
